The program only runs the minimal benchmark suite.
If you want to run the full suite, navigate to FullBenchmarkSuite and run from there.
Note that this suite might take a long time to fully complete.

If you encounter any problem reading the binary file (validPaths.bin),
delete the file and run the program again. It should regenerate the file.
